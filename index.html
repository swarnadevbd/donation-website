            <h1>Their lives depend <br> on your donation</h1>
            <p class="para-1">Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at
                risk,
                threatened by a high risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are crowded
                into emergency flood shelters. <br><br><br>
                Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats to bring relief. Roads and homes have been
                submerged, power stations are down, and over 380 schools have been closed or impacted. </p>

                families have access to clean water and hygiene items during and after the floods. <br><br><br>
                Your donation also helps to ensure continued education for children, providing learning support like
                Emergency Education Kits for 6-to-10-year-olds so they can keep studying. </p>
